For more, learn to save card details after a payment. Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules. For example, if your customer is impacted by SCA, using `off_session` will ensure that they are authenticated while processing this PaymentIntent.
