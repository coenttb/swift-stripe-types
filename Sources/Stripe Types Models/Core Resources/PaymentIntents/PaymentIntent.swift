Use `on_session` if you intend to only reuse the payment method when your customer is present in your checkout flow. Use `off_session` if your customer may or may not be in your checkout flow. For more, learn to save card details after a payment. Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules. For example, if your customer is impacted by SCA, using `off_session` will ensure that they are authenticated while processing this PaymentIntent.
